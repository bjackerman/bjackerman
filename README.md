- 👋 Hi, I’m @bjackerman, (but I tried to give myself a nickname, theHackerman, and start a blog of all the stuff I do thtat isn't cool enough to post here: http://thehackerman.space)
- 👀 I’m interested in OMR for creating custom "scantron" like software for the written events of FBLA-PBL (business club for HS and unviersity students) and I also working on various customization and management ideas for smart home automation.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning React (w/ Material UI, Node.js, etc...) in attempts to create PWAs to handle everyday automation (esp w.r.t. smart homes), brought back out my Arduino (and bought some more) and also start dabbling in ESP32 (and Rasp Pico)
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything listed above or that you think I might be interested in.
- 📫 How to reach me: ...
